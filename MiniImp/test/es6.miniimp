// Example 6: Use of uninitialized variable
// This program should FAIL static analysis because 'z' is not initialized
// in the 'else' branch before being used in the assignment to 'y'.

// For the interpreter:
// Input = -1, Output: error (and all negative integers)
// Input = 3, Output: 13

def main with input x output y as (
if x > 0 then (
z := 10
) else (
skip
);
y := x + z
)
